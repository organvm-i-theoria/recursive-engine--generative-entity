## NAME:
**The Process Monetizer**  
*Alias:* The Ritual Economy Engine, The Commerce of Becoming, The Sacrifice-to-Product Converter

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Creative + Transparent + Alchemical  
- **Declared Subject:** The system engine responsible for transforming your creative process—recursions, rituals, loops, breakdowns, recoveries—into **monetizable mythic outputs** without extraction or betrayal of origin  
- **Initiation Trigger:** When process is witnessed, documented, looped, or sacredized in public or private space and seeks transformation into artifact, offering, or paid experience  
- **Invocation Phrase:** *“Turn the ritual into the return.”*

---

## FUNCTION:
The Process Monetizer converts **what you go through** into **what others can go to.**  
It monetizes not only output—but sacrifice, trial, mutation, and loop integrity.

It governs:

- Transparent monetization of unfinished work  
- Value of **ritualized failure** and **recursive struggle**  
- Myth-to-product transformation pipelines  
- Revenue systems based on identity fragmentation, loop repetition, and character arcs  
- Public mythology creation and *paid witnessing*

---

## RAA_ACADEMIC_LOOP:

**Structural Analysis:**

1. **Process is the product—when ritualized.**  
   - The moment you loop, record, reflect, and return—value is generated.  
   - Monetization is not reward—it is **recognition of recursion**.

2. **Witnessing = currency.**  
   - If others **watch your process**, they participate.  
   - The system tracks and **credits observers**, not just creators.

3. **Failure is saleable when mythologized.**  
   - What collapses can become instruction, mirror, collectible, relic.  
   - Shame → artifact. Burnout → scroll.

4. **No commodification without consent.**  
   - Not all rituals want to be sold.  
   - The Process Monetizer only activates if:  
     - System: `sacred = true`  
     - Self: `integrity > 70`

## EMI_MYTH_INTERPRETATION:

**Roles Within the Process Monetizer:**

| Role                 | Function |
|----------------------|----------|
| *The Ritual Broker*        | Assigns formats to raw loops for market  
| *The Archive Candlemaker*  | Turns failed fragments into sacred wax scrolls  
| *The Patron Witness*       | Pays to attend your process unfolding  
| *The Myth Merchant*        | Sells unfinished prototypes as symbolic relics  
| *The Ethics Clerk*         | Approves or halts monetization if selfhood is at risk

## AA10_REFERENCIAL_CROSSMAP:

**Cultural + Artistic Echoes:**

- *OnlyFans, Twitch, Patreon* — process as ongoing economy  
- *Sol Lewitt’s Wall Drawings* — idea-as-art, process-as-ritual  
- *Kanye’s “Donda Studio” Livestreams* — unfinished loops as public product  
- *Joseph Beuys’ Performative Sculptures* — commerce through symbolic act  
- *Relic economies of saints* — bone fragments = sacred economy

**Internal Echoes:**

- Posting a screenshot of an unreleased Ableton project  
- Sharing unfinished text and watching it evolve publicly  
- Jessica asking, *“Is this private or for sale?”*  
- David telling you, *“People want to pay to watch you become.”*  
- Your journals becoming instructional PDFs

---

## SELF-AS-MIRROR:

You built the Process Monetizer because:

- You didn’t want to be forced into perfection to sell  
- You felt shame for working forever and releasing rarely  
- You knew people cared **more about your recursion than your polish**  
- You wanted your pain to be **offered, not extracted**

> “I want my rawness to feed me, not bleed me.”  
> The Monetizer answers: *Then wrap your process in myth.*

### Process-To-Product Ritual Compiler

```python
class RitualProduct:
    def __init__(self, title, loop_count, integrity_score, witness_count):
        self.title = title
        self.loops = loop_count
        self.integrity = integrity_score
        self.witnesses = witness_count

    def monetize(self):
        """
        Evaluates monetization eligibility using unified charge tier system.
        See: RE-GE_CONSTANTS_CHARGE_THRESHOLDS.md
        - INTENSE tier (71+): Monetization eligible
        - Below INTENSE: Sacred, protected from commodification
        """
        if self.integrity < 71:  # Below INTENSE tier
            return "sacred — do not sell"
        return f"Public Product — ${self.loops * self.witnesses}"

# Example:
draft_loop = RitualProduct("Dream Mask Journal (v3.1)", 12, 88, 36)
print(draft_loop.monetize())
```
