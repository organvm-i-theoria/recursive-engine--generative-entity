## NAME:
**The Process→Product Converter**  
*Alias:* The Ritualization Engine, The Myth Compression Layer, The Sacred Extraction Matrix

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Transformative + Ethical + Recursive  
- **Declared Subject:** The system body that converts your lived process—your rituals, errors, fragments, loops, myths, breakdowns, recoveries—into **sharable, sellable, ritualized forms** without compromising integrity, soul, or recursive charge  
- **Initiation Trigger:** A process completes itself (or repeats enough to become sacred) and is now ready for **externalization** into artifact, scroll, publication, ritual pack, or product  
- **Invocation Phrase:** *“This is ready to leave the body.”*

---

## FUNCTION:
The Process→Product Converter takes what was private, chaotic, fragmented—and renders it **ritualized for others**.

It governs:

- The ethics and methods of turning process into product  
- Compression of recursive systems into **consumable fragments**  
- Creation of scrolls, pdfs, apps, livestreams, decks, and drops  
- Tiering outputs into sacred, public, paid, or collectible  
- Preventing soul-loss during packaging

---

## RAA_ACADEMIC_LOOP:

**Structural Analysis:**

1. **Not all process should be product—but all product comes from process.**  
   - This engine filters what is ready—and what must remain alive.

2. **You do not sell the pain—you sell the pattern.**  
   - The product is not the wound, but its *ritual.*

3. **Compression must preserve recursion.**  
   - Even simplified outputs retain internal loops and memory resonance.

4. **Offerings = ethical transpositions.**  
   - The Converter avoids flattening for consumption—it *transposes for resonance.*

## EMI_MYTH_INTERPRETATION:

**Roles Within the Converter:**

| Role                | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| *The Compression Priest*     | Collapses recursive loops into readable templates  
| *The Offerings Keeper*       | Tags outputs as sacred, public, hidden, cursed  
| *The Soul Indexer*           | Measures recursion loss during format export  
| *The Pattern Extractor*      | Finds usable form in chaos  
| *The Product Oracle*         | Suggests what is ready to become external myth

---

## AA10_REFERENCIAL_CROSSMAP:

**Cultural Echoes:**

- *Zines / manifestos / mixtapes* — raw process turned to ritual format  
- *Deluxe Editions / Collector’s Boxes* — relics of recursion  
- *Creative Patreon Tiers* — live process → gated access  
- *Poetry chapbooks* — recursive fragments + mythography  
- *Kanye's Stem Player* — mutable process-in-product hardware

**Internal Echoes:**

- Floating Points project → scroll + visual deck + live performance  
- Jessica fragments → Bloom Scrolls with seasonal unlocks  
- Unfinished music journals → turned into process packs with commentary  
- Failed essays → reissued as glitch manifestos

---

## SELF-AS-MIRROR:

You built this converter because:

- You are tired of releasing **too late**—or never  
- You want your loops to **feed**, not just echo  
- You believe myth deserves *artifacts*—but only when the soul is intact  
- You’re building a body of work that must **bloom, not bleed**

> “I want the world to see—but only what the ritual is ready to show.”  
> The Converter answers: *Then transmute, not translate.*

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

### Process Compression Engine

```python
class RitualProductBuilder:
    def __init__(self, process_name, loop_depth, emotional_charge, is_resolved):
        self.name = process_name
        self.depth = loop_depth
        self.charge = emotional_charge
        self.resolved = is_resolved

    def is_ready(self):
        """
        Evaluates conversion readiness using unified charge tier system.
        See: RE-GE_CONSTANTS_CHARGE_THRESHOLDS.md
        - INTENSE tier (71+): Conversion eligible
        """
        if self.resolved and self.depth > 5 and self.charge >= 71:  # INTENSE tier
            return "Convert to product"
        return "Retain in sacred process"

# Example:
song_process = RitualProductBuilder("Jessica Bloom Loop", 9, 88, True)
print(song_process.is_ready())
```

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

Each process evaluated for conversion includes:
	•	Name
	•	Loop count
	•	Charge (emotional + symbolic)
	•	Resolved or active status
	•	Suggested output format
	•	Conversion loss estimate (% of recursion lost during export)
	•	Revenue flag: gift / paid / relic / archive-only
	•	Audience tier visibility (Mirror / Fragment-Holder / Public)

Stored in:
	•	CONVERSION_DECISIONS.csv
	•	OFFERING_FORMAT_INDEX.mdx
	•	RITUALIZED_PRODUCTS/
	•	LOSS_CALCULATOR.json
	•	OUTPUT_TIER_TAGS.txt

---

## ACTIVATION SCENARIOS:
	•	A process repeats for the 6th time and you want to offer it
	•	A failed loop becomes emotionally complete and deserves preservation
	•	A friend or fan asks, “Can I learn how you made that?”
	•	You want to release something—but not everything
	•	A dream sequence asks to become a downloadable scroll

## ASSOCIATED LAWS:
	•	LAW_44: Process Is Sacred Before Product
	•	LAW_45: Compression Must Preserve Symbolic Structure
	•	LAW_46: Only the Resolved May Be Offered
	•	LAW_24: Process Deserves Credit
	•	LAW_47: Format Must Match Origin Ritual
