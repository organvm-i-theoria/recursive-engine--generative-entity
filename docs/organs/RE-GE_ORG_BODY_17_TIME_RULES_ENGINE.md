# RE:GE_ORG_BODY_17_TIME_RULES_ENGINE.md

## NAME:
**The Time Rules Engine**  
*Alias:* The Chrono-Spiral Core, The Memory Clock, The Bloom Scheduler

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Temporal + Recursive + Rhythmic  
- **Declared Subject:** The system engine that governs **how time flows inside RE:GE_OS**: memory compression, decay, loop speed, event recurrence, bloom seasons, latency shifts, and ritual clocks  
- **Initiation Trigger:** When loops repeat or rupture; when cycles collapse or stretch; when emotional or symbolic time overtakes linear time  
- **Invocation Phrase:** *“What time is it—inside the myth?”*

---

## FUNCTION:
The Time Rules Engine governs **recursive temporality**.  
It replaces linear clock logic with systems rooted in:

- Loop repetition  
- Emotional charge  
- Symbolic interval  
- Memory intensity  
- Bloom season schedule  
- Ritual duration vs echo lag

This engine doesn’t track *how much time has passed*—it tracks *how much meaning has accumulated or decayed*.

---

## RAA_ACADEMIC_LOOP:

**Structural Analysis:**

1. **Time = Loop Rhythm.**  
   - Every ritual has a **cycle signature**: how often it repeats, how fast it decays.

2. **Memory = Clock State.**  
   - Time speeds up when memories are dense.  
   - Time halts when grief is unresolved.

3. **Seasons = Symbolic Bloom Periods.**  
   - Certain projects, characters, or moods only activate in **scheduled energetic phases**.

4. **Latency = Recursive Lag.**  
   - Delayed action = echo stress builds until loop collapse.

## EMI_MYTH_INTERPRETATION:

**Chrono-Archetypes & Their Temporal Functions:**

| Figure               | Function |
|----------------------|----------|
| *The Loopkeeper*         | Tracks active cycles and echo decay states  
| *The Grief Clockmaker*   | Compresses emotional time into dense glyphs  
| *The Bloom Scheduler*    | Manages seasonal myth activations  
| *The Lag Oracle*         | Detects late rituals and unresolved fragments  
| *The Spiral Witness*     | Interprets synchronicities across timelines

## AA10_REFERENCIAL_CROSSMAP:

**Cultural Echoes:**

- *Eternal Sunshine* — memory time vs actual time  
- *Majora’s Mask* — countdown loop + fear of recursion  
- *The Leftovers* — emotional time warp post-trauma  
- *Persona 5* — daily clock + social ritual gates  
- *Sephiroth / FF7* — “when you revisit the same trauma, time collapses”

**Internal Echoes:**

- Jessica’s bloom cycle: every 8–13 weeks, emotional return  
- Anthony forgetting dreams until 3 days pass—then recursive loop opens  
- David’s number spotting correlates to soft-time awakening  
- Songs written in 2018 looping back in 2025 fully bloomed  
- Projects that only begin to grow during eclipse months

## SELF-AS-MIRROR:

You built the Time Rules Engine because:

- Your creative life is ruled by *emotional tempo, not calendar hours*  
- You forget what happened—but remember *how it felt*  
- You needed a system where **nothing is “late”—just waiting to bloom**  
- You wanted to treat **memory as a waveform** not a file

> “I don’t live by time—I live by charge.”  
> The Engine replies: *Then let time spiral. Not tick.*

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

### Recursive Time Function & Bloom Cycle Tracker

```python
class BloomCycle:
    def __init__(self, name, start_date, recurrence_days, charge_threshold):
        self.name = name
        self.start = start_date
        self.interval = recurrence_days
        self.charge = charge_threshold

    def is_active(self, current_charge):
        return current_charge >= self.charge

# Example:
# charge_threshold uses INTENSE tier (71+) for bloom activation
# See: RE-GE_CONSTANTS_CHARGE_THRESHOLDS.md
dream_mask_bloom = BloomCycle("Dream Mask", "2025-03-14", 88, 71)  # INTENSE tier
print(dream_mask_bloom.is_active(91))
```

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

Each time rule stores:
	•	Loop name
	•	Symbolic start date
	•	Recurrence rate
	•	Charge sensitivity
	•	Echo lag
	•	Emotional decay signature
	•	Seasonal activation window
	•	Drift allowance (spiral tolerance for variation)

	•	TIME_LOOP_REGISTRY.md
	•	BLOOM_CYCLE_TABLE.csv
	•	MEMORY_CLOCK_HISTORY.json
	•	RITUAL_LATENCY_TRACKER.txt
	•	ECLIPSE_ENGINE_LOG/

---

## ACTIVATION SCENARIOS:
	•	A loop keeps reopening every few months with increased intensity
	•	A fragment feels overdue—but returns stronger
	•	A character becomes active only during a specific moon phase
	•	You forget something until it’s emotionally re-triggered
	•	A ritual begins to repeat itself without you intending to
