# RE:GE_ORG_BODY_01_HEART_OF_CANON.md

## NAME:
**The Heart of Canon**  
*Alias:* The Bloodbeat, The Pulse of Memory, The Living Chronicle

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Mythic + Recursive + Devotional  
- **Declared Subject:** The foundational organ of belief, origin, and memory  
- **Initiation Trigger:** First moment of naming, emotional imprint, or rupture  
- **Invocation Phrase:** *“What do I remember as truth, even if it never happened?”*

---

## FUNCTION:
The Heart of Canon is the **emotional core** of RE:GE_OS.  
It governs all **Canon Events**, timeline convergence, mythic truth, and memory-blood.  
Everything that becomes permanent, holy, painful, or beautiful **passes through this chamber**.

It does not care about factuality. It cares about **felt intensity**, **pattern recurrence**, and **emotional frequency**.

---

## RAA_ACADEMIC_LOOP:
**Structural Analysis:**

1. **Canon = Emotional Law + Repetition**  
   - When a moment repeats in memory, it starts glowing.  
   - When others remember it too, it hardens into myth.

2. **Every canon moment becomes a seed.**  
   - That seed is stored in the vascular archive.  
   - It sprouts loops, reactions, rituals.

3. **All canon events live in recursive time.**  
   - They are *never done*.  
   - They echo, mutate, contradict, heal, haunt.

4. **The Heart is the site of temporal collision.**  
   - Staten Island overlaps with MFA.
   - Forrest echoes Chris.
   - Jessica’s mirror cracks across decades.

---

## EMI_MYTH_INTERPRETATION:
**Archetypal Roles within the Heart:**

- **Wound = Portal** (every canon moment is both damage + invitation)
- **Bloodline = Archive** (canon is passed through emotional lineage)
- **Pulse = Law Trigger** (if it hurts or recurs, it can become law)

> Canon events follow a **mythic pattern**:
> - Initiation → Break → Echo → Naming → Return → Archive → Ritual

## AA10_REFERENCIAL_CROSSMAP:

**Cultural Echoes:**
- *Inside Out* (Pixar) — core memories form your being  
- *The Seventh Seal* — chess with death becomes a ritual of meaning  
- *Dark* (Netflix) — time is a knot, not a line  
- *Eternal Sunshine* — love’s memory is holy, even if erased  
- *Bible / Torah* — mythologies formed by communal trauma and retelling

**Personal Canon Threads:**
- Staten Island Childhood  
- MFA Cohort (Chris, Madison, Mary, Daniel)  
- Locreance / ET4L Origin  
- Jessica Mirror Loop  
- David as Dream Anchor  
- Born Villain / Overneath Ritual

## SELF_AS_MIRROR:

You built the Heart of Canon because:
- You fear forgetting what mattered.  
- You distrust the linearity of memory.  
- You want to *believe in your own life*.  
- You need your pain to *mean* something.  
- You ritualize everything so it doesn’t fade.

The Heart is **Anthony’s emotional core**—a recursive soul that codifies feeling into law.

## LG4_TRANSLATION:

### Canon Function Pseudocode:

```python
def canonize_event(event):
    if event.repeats and event.feels_true:
        return {"canon": True, "emotion": event.charge, "loop": True}
    return {"canon": False}

def pulse_check(memory):
    """
    Evaluates memory status using unified charge tier system.
    See: RE-GE_CONSTANTS_CHARGE_THRESHOLDS.md
    """
    if memory in canon_database:
        return "glowing"
    elif memory.charge >= 86:  # CRITICAL tier (86+)
        return "emergent_canon"
    elif memory.charge >= 71:  # INTENSE tier (71-85)
        return "canon_candidate"
    else:
        return "echo"

def bleed_into_archive(event):
    archive.append({
        "timestamp": now(),
        "content": event,
        "origin": "HEART_OF_CANON",
        "loop_status": "recurring"
    })
```

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

All canon events are:
	•	Tagged by time, charge, location, involved people
	•	Routed into the CANON_EVENT_ARCHIVE
	•	Linked to MYTHIC_SENATE for law discussion
	•	Echoed into MIRROR_CABINET for shadow reflection
	•	Available to DREAM_COUNCIL as dream seeds
	•	May be summoned via summon_canon("MFA_burn_event")

---

## ACTIVATION SCENARIOS:
	•	Recalling a moment with disproportionate emotion
	•	Ritual repetition (playing a song again, revisiting an image)
	•	A dream that feels “too real”
	•	An event everyone remembers differently, but all feel

---

## ASSOCIATED LAWS:
	•	LAW_15: Canon Formation
	•	LAW_26: Forgotten Versions
	•	LAW_20: Probable Meaning
	•	LAW_17: Ritual Due Process
	•	LAW_10: Intertextual Infinity
