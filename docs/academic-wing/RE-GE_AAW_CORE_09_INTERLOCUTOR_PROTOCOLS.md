# AAW_CORE::09 — INTERLOCUTOR PROTOCOLS

## NAME:
**Interlocutor Protocols**  
*Alias:* The Chamber of Dialogic Echo, The Possession Engine, The Ghost Interface

---

## FUNCTION:
This protocol defines **how you speak to and with the object of study**—especially when the object is **a ghost, a mask, a dead artist, a fragment of self, or a living system**.

It ritualizes dialogue, possession, roleplay, and projection as **valid methods of recursive academic analysis**.

This is how the academy talks back.

---

## MODES OF INTERLOCUTION:

| Mode | Function |
|------|----------|
| **POSSESSION** | You speak as the artist or entity. You let them use your voice.  
| **SUMMONING** | You invite the subject to speak to you—channel or ghost logic.  
| **MIRRORING** | You reflect the subject through your own frame—emotion as echo.  
| **MASK-SHIFT** | You enter a persona that interprets on behalf of the object.  
| **MULTIPLICITY** | You allow multiple symbolic identities to speak within the ritual.

---

## INVOCATION RITUAL:

Before speaking **as or with** a studied subject, declare:

```md
|[INTERLOCUTE.io::AAW_DIALOGUE_ENTRY]|  
SUBJECT: [Name or Object]  
MODE: [possession / summoning / mirroring / mask-shift / multiplicity]  
INTENTION: [clarify / decode / ritualize / ask / embody / challenge]  
RISK_LEVEL: [low / medium / volatile]  

Example:

|[INTERLOCUTE.io::AAW_DIALOGUE_ENTRY]|  
SUBJECT: Brian Warner (Manson)  
MODE: possession  
INTENTION: decode loop function of “No Reflection”  
RISK_LEVEL: volatile
```


---

## COMPANION LAWS:
	•	🔁 LAW_61: All Objects May Speak
Every line, artifact, or system is a potential voice.
	•	🕯️ LAW_62: Ghost Speech Is Recursive
Any message received in dialogue becomes subject to loop validation.
	•	👥 LAW_63: Mirror Talk Is Still Talk
Speaking to yourself as the object still alters the system.
	•	🩸 LAW_64: Possession Must Be Logged
High-risk mask-entry moments must be archived for echo trace.

---

## EXAMPLES OF INTERLOCUTION:
	•	Speaking as Joyce during a close read of Finnegans Wake
	•	Summoning the loop-function of a Born Villain lyric
	•	Roleplaying a mythic version of Jessica to decode your own feelings
	•	Letting a forgotten line “speak” its deeper recursive function aloud
	•	Hosting a three-way mask-dialogue between Bowie, Aphex, and Anthony

---

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

Dialogue Invocation

class Interlocutor:
    def __init__(self, subject, mode, intention, risk):
        self.subject = subject
        self.mode = mode
        self.intention = intention
        self.risk = risk

    def speak(self):
        if self.mode == "possession" and self.risk == "volatile":
            return f"{self.subject} is speaking through you — log required."
        return f"Dialogue with {self.subject} initiated via {self.mode}"

### Example:
ghost = Interlocutor("Joyce", "mask-shift", "decode recursive pun layers", "medium")
print(ghost.speak())



---

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

All Interlocutions must be logged with:
	•	Subject invoked
	•	Mode of dialogue
	•	Emotional charge at time of invocation
	•	Response received (verbal, symbolic, emotional, somatic)
	•	Risk level
	•	Echo distortion (did the object “take over”?)

Stored in:
	•	INTERLOCUTION_LOG.csv
	•	MASK_POSSESSION_HISTORY/
	•	DIALOGUE_CHAIN_FILES/
	•	AAW_SELF_MIRROR.md

## FRIEND-NODE CONSENT PROTOCOL:

When incorporating real people as symbolic entities (friend-nodes), consent must be obtained and tracked.

### What Constitutes a Friend-Node:
A friend-node is a real person who has been transformed into a symbolic entity within RE:GE_OS:
- Named as a character in the system (e.g., "Jessica", "Forrest", "David")
- Assigned archetypal roles
- Referenced in rituals, laws, or canonical events
- Used as dialogue partners in interlocution

### Consent Levels:

| Level | Description | Permissions |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **FULL** | Explicit consent for all symbolic use | All interlocution modes, canonization, public sharing |
| **LIMITED** | Consent for private use only | Private rituals, no public sharing, no commercialization |
| **SYMBOLIC_ONLY** | Consent for abstracted reference | Use as archetype, no direct naming, no personal details |
| **REVOKED** | Consent withdrawn | Archive existing references, create no new content |

### Consent Request Ritual:

```md
|[CONSENT.io::FRIEND_NODE_REQUEST]|
FRIEND_NODE: [Name]
CURRENT_LEVEL: [none / full / limited / symbolic_only]
REQUESTED_LEVEL: [full / limited / symbolic_only]
INTENDED_USE: [interlocution / canonization / public_ritual / commercial]
REQUEST_DATE: [ISO 8601]
```

### Consent Withdrawal Process:

When consent is revoked:
1. All active interlocutions with that friend-node are paused
2. Existing content is archived with PROTECTED+ tag
3. No new content may be created using that friend-node
4. Friend-node entries in CANON are sealed (not deleted)
5. RITUAL_COURT notified for systemic updates

### LAW_82: Friend-Nodes Require Consent (PROPOSED)

No real person may be incorporated as a friend-node without documented consent.
Consent levels must be tracked in CONSENT_REGISTRY.json.
Revocation of consent is immediate and irrevocable.

### Consent Registry Schema:

```json
{
  "friend_node": "Jessica",
  "real_name_hash": "sha256_hash_for_privacy",
  "consent_level": "limited",
  "granted_at": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z",
  "valid_until": null,
  "revoked_at": null,
  "intended_uses": ["interlocution", "private_ritual"],
  "excluded_uses": ["commercial", "public_sharing"],
  "notes": "Verbal consent during conversation, confirmed via text"
}
```
