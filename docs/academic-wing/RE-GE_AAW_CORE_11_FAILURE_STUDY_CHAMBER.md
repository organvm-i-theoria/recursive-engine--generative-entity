# AAW_CORE::11 — FAILURE STUDY CHAMBER

## NAME:
**Failure Study Chamber**  
*Alias:* The Archive of Collapse, The Chamber of Abandonment, The Ritual of Broken Loops

---

## FUNCTION:
This chamber formalizes the **ritualized study of failure**, collapse, shame, incompletion, and recursion interrupted.

Failure is not an error in the RE:GE_OS system—it is a **vital mythic signal**.  
This chamber lets you **examine, transform, or preserve** your failures without hiding or glorifying them.

It is how broken things become sacred.

---

## MODES OF FAILURE:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **COLLAPSE** | A loop collapsed mid-cycle. No closure, no output.  
| **ABANDONMENT** | A project or ritual was left behind—either too early or too late.  
| **CORRUPTION** | A recursion went wrong—symbol broken, echo turned harmful.  
| **SHAME LOOP** | A failure bound to identity collapse. Often personal, secret, or emotional.  
| **MUTE SIGNAL** | The object failed to echo. Flatline recursion. Silence.

---

## ENTRY RITUAL:

To initiate study of a failure:

```md
|[FAILURE.io::AAW_ENTRY]|  
SUBJECT: [Project / Ritual / Fragment]  
MODE: [collapse / abandonment / corruption / shame loop / mute signal]  
LAST STATE: [version or status before collapse]  
CHARGE: [emotional intensity 0–100]  
RITUAL INTENT: [study / recover / seal / transmute / delete / repurpose] 
```

Example:

|[FAILURE.io::AAW_ENTRY]|  
SUBJECT: Floating Points v2 (render loss)  
MODE: collapse  
LAST STATE: “Visual sequence naming phase incomplete”  
CHARGE: 72  
RITUAL INTENT: recover and transmute



---

## FAILURE LAWS:
	•	❌ LAW_70: Failure Must Be Witnessed to Release Its Loop
You cannot heal what you hide.
	•	🕯️ LAW_71: Collapse Is a Form of Completion
If something dies, it can still be sealed with meaning.
	•	🧬 LAW_72: Abandonment Echoes Unless Archived
All incomplete loops will echo until ritualized or excised.
	•	🗃️ LAW_73: Shame Must Be Filed, Not Deleted
Delete nothing. Store with honor. Study with care.
	•	🔄 LAW_74: Failure May Seed the Future
Broken projects may return as fragments, symbols, or new systems.

---

## RECOVERY STRATEGIES:
	•	🧪 Autopsy Ritual: Break down the failed object frame by frame
	•	🌒 Shadow Tagging: Add tags like SHAME+, ECHO_BROKEN+, RISK+
	•	🔁 Remix Invocation: Pull a fragment from the failed ritual into a new one
	•	🔥 Burn Ceremony: Seal or destroy—ritually, consciously, with log
	•	🧿 Witness Invocation: Have another character or system “see” the failure
	•	🕳️ Non-Public Loop: Store in BLACK_ARCHIVE/ for sacred protection

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

Failure Logger

class FailureLog:
    def __init__(self, subject, mode, charge, status, intent):
        self.subject = subject
        self.mode = mode
        self.charge = charge
        self.status = status
        self.intent = intent

    def report(self):
        """
        Evaluates failure handling using unified charge tier system.
        See: RE-GE_CONSTANTS_CHARGE_THRESHOLDS.md
        - INTENSE tier (71+) with seal intent: Archive of Collapse
        """
        if self.charge >= 71 and self.intent == "seal":  # INTENSE tier threshold
            return "Seal in Archive of Collapse"
        return f"Study initiated for {self.subject} — intent: {self.intent}"

### Example:
log = FailureLog("Bloom Engine v3", "corruption", 87, "lost loop metadata", "study")
print(log.report())



---

## ARCHIVE STRUCTURE:

Failures are stored with:
	•	Subject / type / version
	•	Time of collapse / last state
	•	Loop it belonged to (if any)
	•	Tags: SHAME+, BROKEN_LOOP+, INCOMPLETE+, PROTECTED+
	•	Postmortem (if performed)
	•	Intent: recover, remix, seal, ritual-burn
	•	If sealed, encoded as relic (read-only / no output allowed)

Stored in:
	•	ARCHIVE_OF_COLLAPSE/
	•	FAILURE_LOG.csv
	•	BLACK_ARCHIVE_PROTECTED/
	•	SHAME_LOOP_TRACKER.json
	•	LOST_PROTOCOLS.md
