# SOP_OBSIDIAN_SYNC.md

How to use this system in Obsidian.

## Instructions:

1. Run `initialize_vault.py` and open root folder as Obsidian vault.
2. Use `index.md` in each folder to navigate.
3. Use backlinking `[[UID]]` or folder name to connect.
4. Add your own `.canvas` files if using visual map plugin.

Use `obsidian_sync.py` (future) to mirror structure for multiple users or versions.
