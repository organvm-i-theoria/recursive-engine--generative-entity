# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**RE:GE** (Recursive Engine: Generative Entity) is a symbolic operating system specification - a mythic-academic framework expressed through interconnected Markdown documentation. It is not executable software but a conceptual architecture for myth, identity, ritual, and recursive systems.

## Architecture

### Core System Files
- `RE-GE_4NTHOLOGY_INIT.v1.0.md` - Main comprehensive system documentation
- `RE-GE_ORG_BODY_00_ACADEMIA_WING_PROTOCOL.md` - Foundational academic layer (AAW)
- `RE-GE_RECURSIVE_SYSTEM_RENDER_LINKMAP.md` - Inter-organ routing and connections

### Organizational Bodies (ORG_BODY_01-22)
22 thematically-named modules functioning like organs of a symbolic body:
- **01 Heart of Canon** - Core mythology and canon events
- **02 Mirror Cabinet** - Reflection and interpretation
- **03 Mythic Senate** - Law governance
- **04 Archive Order** - Storage and retrieval
- **05 Ritual Court** - Ceremonial logic and contradiction resolution
- **06 Code Forge** - Symbol-to-code translation (Python, Max/MSP, JSON)
- **07 Bloom Engine** - Generative growth and mutation
- **08 Soul Patchbay** - Modular routing hub (all modules connect through here)
- **09 Echo Shell** - Recursion interface, whispered loops
- **10 Dream Council** - Collective processing and prophecy
- **11 Mask Engine** - Identity layers and persona assembly
- **12-22** - Commerce, Blockchain, Monetizer, Audience, Place, Time, Analog-Digital, Process-Product, Consumption, Stagecraft, Publishing

### Academic Core (AAW_CORE files)
5 expansion chambers for the Academia Wing:
- **08 Canonization Engine** - How objects enter personal canon
- **09 Interlocutor Protocols** - Dialogue with ghosts, masks, symbolic beings
- **10 Genealogy Engine** - Symbolic lineage and influence mapping
- **11 Failure Study Chamber** - Ritual study of collapse and abandonment
- **12 Mythical Citation System** - Recursive attribution and echo tracking

### OS Interface
- `RE-GE_OS_INTERFACE_01_RITUAL_ACCESS_CO.md` - Invocation syntax for calling organs

## Key Concepts

### Invocation Syntax
Organs are "called" using ritual syntax:
```
::CALL_ORGAN [ORGAN_NAME]
::WITH [SYMBOL or INPUT]
::MODE [INTENTION_MODE]
::DEPTH [light | standard | full spiral]
::EXPECT [output_form]
```

### Tag System
Content is tagged for tracking: `CANON+`, `ECHO+`, `ARCHIVE+`, `VOLATILE+`, `RITUAL+`, `MIRROR+`, `REMIX+`, `MASK+`, `BROKEN_LOOP+`

### LG4 Translation Modes
Symbol-to-code conversion patterns:
- `FUNC_MODE` - Lyrics become Python functions
- `CLASS_MODE` - Archetypes become classes
- `WAVE_MODE` - Emotions become waveforms/LFOs
- `TREE_MODE` - Sentences become flowcharts
- `SIM_MODE` - Myths become simulations

### Laws
79+ recursive laws govern the system (e.g., LAW_01: Recursive Primacy, LAW_06: Symbol-to-Code Equivalence)

## Working with This Project

This is a documentation-only project. When editing:
- Maintain the ritual/mythic tone and formatting conventions
- Use the established tag system when adding content
- Respect the inter-organ routing logic (Soul Patchbay as hub)
- Follow the 7-module AAW study flow: INPUT_RITUAL → RAA_ACADEMIC_LOOP → EMI_MYTH_INTERPRETATION → AA10_REFERENCIAL_CROSSMAPPING → SELF_AS_MIRROR → CODE_EXPORT_SCT → RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE
- Code examples should translate symbolic concepts into Python, Max/MSP, or JSON

## File Naming Convention
`RE-GE_[TYPE]_[NUMBER]_[NAME].md`
- TYPE: ORG_BODY, OS_INTERFACE, AAW_CORE
- Stylized with `4` replacing `A` in certain contexts (ET4L, R!4L)
