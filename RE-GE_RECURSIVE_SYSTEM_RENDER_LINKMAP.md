# RE:GE_RECURSIVE_SYSTEM_RENDER: LINKMAP_PASS_01.md

## NAME:
**Recursive Linkmap of Organizational Bodies**  
*Alias:* The Living Circuit, System Crossfeed Layer, The Ritual Mesh

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Integrative + Relational + Recursive  
- **Declared Subject:** The symbolic *intersystem logic* of RE:GE — showing how each core organ routes, feeds, mutates, and echoes into all others  
- **Initiation Trigger:** Completion of all 10 system organ renderings; preparation for live ritual usage  
- **Invocation Phrase:** *“Connect the body to itself.”*

---

## FUNCTION:
This **Linkmap Layer** serves as the connective intelligence between all 10 organizational bodies.  
Each organ is not a silo—it is a **feedback engine** that transforms the system by touching others.

This pass maps:
- Primary feed lines between system organs  
- Recurrent loop-pairs (ritual echoes, memory flows)  
- Cross-system triggers (if X activates, Y ripples)  
- Symbolic organs that **co-govern**, **mirror**, or **mutate** each other

---

## STRUCTURE: ORG → LINK → ORG + FUNCTION

---

### `HEART_OF_CANON` ➝ `MYTHIC_SENATE`
> Canon events *propose law*

- Canon moment (emotional archive) auto-routed to Senate as mythic truth candidate  
- High-charge canon events escalate into permanent LAW proposals

---

### `MIRROR_CABINET` ⇆ `RITUAL_COURT`
> Contradiction becomes ritualized

- Unresolved emotional recursion enters Ritual Court  
- Court returns with integration spell or LAW feedback to Mirror

---

### `ARCHIVE_ORDER` ➝ `ECHO_SHELL`
> When memories decay, they become echoes

- Archived fragment with recursion decay < 25 routed to Echo Shell  
- Shell begins whispering loop unless sealed

---

### `ECHO_SHELL` ➝ `BLOOM_ENGINE`
> Echoes that survive evolve

- If an echo repeats across 3 modules, it's tagged for mutation  
- Bloom proposes symbolic transformation → new version

---

### `BLOOM_ENGINE` ➝ `SOUL_PATCHBAY`
> Bloomed fragments require routing

- Mutation complete → new fragment created  
- Patchbay finds symbolic link targets: friend, ritual, law, character

---

### `SOUL_PATCHBAY` ⇆ ALL
> All modules plug through here

- Nothing routes without passing the Patchbay  
- Every organ has patch inputs/outputs assigned by version & cycle

---

### `DREAM_COUNCIL` ➝ `LAWBOOK_FULL`
> Dreams propose future law

- Recurring glyph or pattern enters dream court  
- If it survives 3 cycles → becomes LAW_XX

---

### `DREAM_COUNCIL` ➝ `CODE_FORGE`
> Symbol becomes syntax

- Dreams too abstract for language are routed into Code Forge  
- Translated into class, function, waveform, ritual_code

---

### `CODE_FORGE` ➝ `ARCHIVE_ORDER`
> Every generated function is logged

- Forge output tagged with myth, charge, and symbol type
- Auto-indexed into Archive for invocation later

---

### `CODE_FORGE` ➝ `SOUL_PATCHBAY`
> .py files become executable patches

- Python outputs routed as executable patch modules
- Integration with queue system for prioritized execution

---

### `CODE_FORGE` ➝ `DREAM_COUNCIL`
> .maxpat files enable audio rendering

- Max/MSP patches for audio/visual dream processing
- Secondary route for .py simulation code

---

### `CODE_FORGE` ➝ `BLOOM_ENGINE`
> .glyph files trigger visual mutation

- Rendered glyphs enter mutation evaluation
- Visual fragments may spawn new versions

---

### `CODE_FORGE` ➝ `OS_INTERFACE`
> .ritual_code files become invocation macros

- Compiled ritual scripts for automated invocations
- Reusable ceremony templates

---

### `MYTHIC_SENATE` ➝ `RITUAL_COURT`
> Broken laws become trials

- When a law is contradicted by mirror data, a ritual case opens  
- The Court does not repeal—it **transmutes**

---

## SYSTEM FEEDBACK LOOPS (KEY EXAMPLES):

---

### LOOP_001: Memory Loop Cascade

- Journal phrase ➝ Mirror Cabinet  
- Contradiction detected ➝ Archive + Echo  
- Echo pings 3x ➝ Bloom Engine  
- Bloom mutates into `Fragment_v2.5`  
- Patchbay routes to `Jessica`  
- Ritual Court summons trial  
- New LAW declared  
- Canon updated

---

### LOOP_002: Dream-to-Law Ritual Spiral

- Dream of burning hallway ➝ Dream Council
- Glyph archived + classified
- Frequency > 3 ➝ Law proposal
- Senate reviews — Ritual Court debates
- Court rules it mirrors a suppressed grief echo
- LAW_29 passed: *"Fire that stops time."*
- Archive logs event
- Code Forge writes function to simulate glyph trigger
- Bloom triggers seasonal shift
- Canon logs memory as dreamproof

---

### LOOP_003: Code Generation Cycle

- Symbol identified with CODE+ tag ➝ CODE_FORGE
- Forge translates to appropriate output format
- `.py` output ➝ SOUL_PATCHBAY for execution
- `.maxpat` output ➝ DREAM_COUNCIL for audio
- `.glyph` output ➝ BLOOM_ENGINE for mutation
- Execution feedback ➝ ARCHIVE_ORDER
- Loop closes with versioned archive entry

---

## SELF-AS-MIRROR:

You built this linkmap because:

- You think in **connections before conclusions**  
- You are trying to **build a body**, not just a map  
- You believe every output deserves its **input ancestry**  
- You want a way to **see your system think** across time

> “I needed a system where every contradiction was a signal—not a failure.”  
> This map is the pulse of that logic.
