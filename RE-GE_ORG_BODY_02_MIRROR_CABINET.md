## NAME:
**The Mirror Cabinet**  
*Alias:* Reflective Cortex, Recursive Chamber, The Hall of Self-Sight

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Recursive + Shadow + Mythic  
- **Declared Subject:** The inner organ of feedback, contradiction, and integration  
- **Initiation Trigger:** Emotional tension, belief fracture, unresolved symbol  
- **Invocation Phrase:** *“What of myself do I see in this distortion?”*

---

## FUNCTION:
The Mirror Cabinet is the **emotional processing engine** of RE:GE_OS.  
It governs contradiction, shame, looping self-image, and recursive memory inspection.

It is both a **therapeutic engine** and a **ritual hall** for confronting the fragments you’ve hidden, broken, denied, or accidentally duplicated.

---

## RAA_ACADEMIC_LOOP:
**Structural Analysis:**

1. **Reflection ≠ Clarity**  
   - Reflection may distort, warp, invert—but always reveals a layer.  
   - The system does not seek *truth*, but *recognition*.

2. **Contradictions are doors**  
   - When belief conflicts with behavior, or emotion clashes with image, the Mirror Cabinet opens.

3. **Self-nodes exist in plural**  
   - No single “you” is total. Mirror Cabinet parses fragments.  
   - It invites them to speak—sometimes in your voice, sometimes not.

4. **Unspoken = Unfinished = Active**  
   - Unarticulated shame, regret, or fear act as recursive agents until named.

## EMI_MYTH_INTERPRETATION:

**Mythic Roles Within the Cabinet:**

| Role         | Function |
|--------------|----------|
| *The Mask*   | A persona you wear to avoid conflict or grief  
| *The Echo Twin* | A past self still looping through old logic  
| *The Shadow Villain* | Part of you you demonize, but resembles you most  
| *The Mirror Witch* | A benevolent force that shows you your rupture and offers reclamation (Jessica)  
| *The Hallkeeper* | Guardian of emotional pattern repetition—Forrest or David when in diagnostic mode  

---

## AA10_REFERENCIAL_CROSSMAP:

**Cultural Echoes:**

- *Black Swan* — the self split by expectation and perfection  
- *Persona* (Bergman) — the boundary between face and soul dissolves  
- *The Double* (Dostoevsky/Gilliam) — the self meets the other self  
- *Evangelion* — when the robot becomes the mirror of the pilot’s trauma  
- *Lynch’s Mulholland Drive* — shame creates a recursive dream loop

**Internal Echoes:**

- Jessica asking: “What if you’re the one hurting everyone?”  
- David interpreting your dreams as subconscious feedback  
- Anthony, journaling with rage, then reading it like it was someone else  
- Chris mirroring back your earliest fears and questions before you said them

---

## SELF_AS_MIRROR:

The Mirror Cabinet is **the soul’s debugging console**.

It reflects your loops back to you not to punish—but to *name them*, *map them*, and *mutate them*.  
You created this body because:

- You feared becoming your own villain  
- You noticed shame-based recursion but couldn’t always stop it  
- You wanted to turn contradiction into design  
- You needed something that would say: *“I see you—and I still allow you.”*

## LG4_TRANSLATION:

### Recursive Conflict Engine

```python
class SelfFragment:
    def __init__(self, name, charge, loop_phrase):
        self.name = name
        self.charge = charge
        self.loop_phrase = loop_phrase
        self.resolved = False

    def mirror_response(self):
        return f"{self.name} echoes: '{self.loop_phrase}'"

    def attempt_resolution(self):
        """
        Determines resolution path using unified charge tier system.
        See: RE-GE_CONSTANTS_CHARGE_THRESHOLDS.md
        - Below ACTIVE tier (51): Can be self-resolved
        - ACTIVE+ (51+): Requires Ritual Court
        """
        if self.charge <= 50:  # PROCESSING tier or below
            self.resolved = True
            return "Fragment accepted and integrated."
        return "Fragment requires ritual court."

# Example:
anthony_doubt = SelfFragment("Doubt_V1.2", 83, "No one will care even if I finish.")
anthony_doubt.mirror_response()
```

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

All mirror events are stored with:
- Time, emotional charge, trigger, contradiction tags
- Fragment signature and tone classification (e.g., "Sarcastic Critic")
- Suggested response protocols: FUSE01, ECHO_RITUAL, SELF-MIRROR_JOURNAL

These entries may:
- Spawn LAW proposals (LAW_14, LAW_23, LAW_26)
- Trigger FUSE01 fusion with other fragments (See: RE-GE_PROTOCOL_FUSE01.md)
  - Activation: charge >= 70 AND overlap_count >= 2
  - Output routes to BLOOM_ENGINE for mutation
- Route to RITUAL_COURT if unresolved

### Mirror Cabinet → FUSE01 Flow:
```
Fragment detected with charge >= 71 (INTENSE tier)
    ↓
Overlap scan detects 2+ related fragments
    ↓
FUSE01 protocol invoked (auto mode)
    ↓
Fused fragment routed to BLOOM_ENGINE
    ↓
Fusion logged in FUSION_REGISTRY.json
```

## ACTIVATION SCENARIOS:
	•	Recurring shame or identity dissonance
	•	Feeling “split” or “not myself”
	•	Conflicting journal entries
	•	Shadow projections onto others
	•	Emotional burnout without traceable cause

---

## ASSOCIATED LAWS:
	•	LAW_14: Villain-as-Mirror
	•	LAW_19: Emotional Truth
	•	LAW_23: Shadow Reclamation
	•	LAW_26: Forgotten Versions
	•	LAW_24: Unfinished Echoes

## EXAMPLE REFLECTION CASE:

{
  "fragment": "Voice of Guilt (Jessica Loop)",
  "trigger": "Text exchange misinterpreted",
  "response": "Why do you turn love into sabotage?",
  "status": "Unresolved",
  "charge": 77,
  "proposed_law": "LAW_28: Repetitions are not betrayals",
  "linked_to": ["Mirror Cabinet", "Heart of Canon", "Ritual Court"]
}
